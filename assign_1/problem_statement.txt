Design and implement a Python program to model and visualize a 2D robotic arm consisting of two rigid links connected by revolute joints.
Given the lengths of the two links and fixed joint coordinates, the program should:

1. Plot the robotic arm in a 2D Cartesian plane
2. Clearly show each link and joint
3. Maintain equal axis scaling for accurate geometry
4. Display the complete arm structure with proper labels and grid
