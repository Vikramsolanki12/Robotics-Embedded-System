Design and implement a Python program to animate the absolute rotation of a 2D geometric object about the origin using rotation transformation principles.
Given a set of Cartesian coordinates representing the vertices of a hut-shaped object, the program should:

1. Apply the standard 2D rotation transformation to the object
2. Continuously rotate the object through angles from 0° to 360°
3. Update and display the rotated shape at each step using animation
4. Plot both the outline and filled region of the object
5. Maintain equal axis scaling to preserve geometric accuracy
