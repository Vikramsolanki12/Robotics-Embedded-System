Develop a Python program to rotate a 2D geometric shape about the origin by a specified angle using rotation transformation equations.
Given a set of vertices representing a 2D object and a rotation angle in degrees, the program should:

1. Apply absolute rotation using trigonometric rotation formulas
2. Compute new coordinates of all vertices after rotation
3. Plot both the original and rotated shapes on the same graph
4. Preserve the shape geometry using equal axis scaling
