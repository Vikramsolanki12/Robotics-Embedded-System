Design and implement a Python program to generate a geometric pattern by applying rotational transformation to a base S-shaped curve.
Given a parametric representation of an S-curve in a 2D Cartesian plane, the program should:

1. Rotate the curve about the origin by a fixed angular increment
2. Apply the standard 2D rotation transformation at each step
3. Plot all rotated instances to form a symmetric artistic pattern
4. Maintain equal axis scaling to preserve the curve geometry
